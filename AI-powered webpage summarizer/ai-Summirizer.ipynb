It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the input and output, meaning the output changes at a constant rate as the input changes. This relationship is represented by a straight line.\n","For example\n","we want to predict a student's exam score based on how many hours they studied. We observe that as students study more hours, their scores go up. In the example of predicting exam scores based on hours studied. Here\n","Independent variable (input):\n","Hours studied because it's the factor we control or observe.\n","Dependent variable (output):\n","Exam score because it depends on how many hours were studied.\n","We use the independent variable to predict the dependent variable.\n","Why Linear Regression is Important?\n","Here’s why linear regression is important:\n","Simplicity and Interpretability:\n","It’s easy to understand and interpret, making it a starting point for learning about machine learning.\n","Predictive Ability\n",": Helps predict future outcomes based on past data, making it useful in various fields like finance, healthcare and marketing.\n","Basis for Other Models:\n","Many advanced algorithms, like logistic regression or neural networks, build on the concepts of linear regression.\n","Efficiency:\n","It’s computationally efficient and works well for problems with a linear relationship.\n","Widely Used:\n","It’s one of the most widely used techniques in both statistics and machine learning for regression tasks.\n","Analysis:\n","It provides insights into relationships between variables (e.g., how much one variable influences another).\n","Best Fit Line in Linear Regression\n","In linear regression, the best-fit line is the straight line that most accurately represents the relationship between the independent variable (input) and the dependent variable (output). It is the line that minimizes the difference between the actual data points and the predicted values from the model.\n","1. Goal of the Best-Fit Line\n","The goal of linear regression is to find a straight line that minimizes the error (the difference) between the observed data points and the predicted values. This line helps us predict the dependent variable for new, unseen data.\n","Linear Regression\n","Here Y is called a dependent or target variable and X is called an independent variable also known as the predictor of Y. There are many types of functions or modules that can be used for regression. A linear function is the simplest type of function. Here, X may be a single feature or multiple features representing the problem.\n","2. Equation of the Best-Fit Line\n","For simple linear regression (with one independent variable), the best-fit line is represented by the equation\n","y = mx + b\n","Where:\n","y\n","is the predicted value (dependent variable)\n","x\n","is the input (independent variable)\n","m\n","is the slope of the line (how much y changes when x changes)\n","b\n","is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0)\n","The best-fit line will be the one that optimizes the values of m (slope) and b (intercept) so that the predicted y values are as close as possible to the actual data points.\n","3. Minimizing the Error: The Least Squares Method\n","To find the best-fit line, we use a method called\n","Least Squares\n",". The idea behind this method is to minimize the sum of squared differences between the actual values (data points) and the predicted values from the line. These differences are called residuals.\n","The formula for residuals is:\n","Residual = yᵢ - ŷᵢ\n","Where:\n","yᵢ\n","is the actual observed value\n","ŷᵢ\n","is the predicted value from the line for that\n","xᵢ\n","The least squares method minimizes the sum of the squared residuals:\n","Sum of squared errors (SSE) = Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²\n","This method ensures that the line best represents the data where the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and actual values is as small as possible.\n","4. Interpretation of the Best-Fit Line\n","Slope (m):\n","The slope of the best-fit line indicates how much the dependent variable (y) changes with each unit change in the independent variable (x). For example if the slope is 5, it means that for every 1-unit increase in x, the value of y increases by 5 units.\n","Intercept (b):\n","The intercept represents the predicted value of y when x = 0. It’s the point where the line crosses the y-axis.\n","In linear regression some hypothesis are made to ensure reliability of the model's results.\n","Limitations\n","Assumes Linearity:\n","The method assumes the relationship between the variables is linear. If the relationship is non-linear, linear regression might not work well.\n","Sensitivity to Outliers:\n","Outliers can significantly affect the slope and intercept, skewing the best-fit line.\n","Hypothesis function in Linear Regression\n","In linear regression, the hypothesis function is the equation used to make predictions about the dependent variable based on the independent variables. It represents the relationship between the input features and the target output.\n","For a simple case with one independent variable, the hypothesis function is:\n","h(x) = β₀ + β₁x\n","Where:\n","h(x) (or ŷ)\n","is the predicted value of the dependent variable (y).\n","x\n","x\n","is the independent variable.\n","β₀\n","is the intercept, representing the value of y when x is 0.\n","β₁\n","is the slope, indicating how much y changes for each unit change in x.\n","For\n","multiple linear regression\n","(with more than one independent variable), the hypothesis function expands to:\n","h(x₁, x₂, ..., xₖ) = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₖxₖ\n","Where:\n","x₁, x₂, ..., xₖ\n","are the independent variables.\n","β₀\n","is the intercept.\n","β₁, β₂, ..., βₖ\n","are the coefficients, representing the influence of each respective independent variable on the predicted output.\n","Assumptions of the Linear Regression\n","1.

Independence of Errors\n",": The errors in predictions should not affect each other.\n","3.
